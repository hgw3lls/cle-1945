        "Description": "One of two theatres occupying the large Loewâ€™s Building (the other being the State Theatre), the Ohio Theatre opened on February 14, 1921 with 2,153 seats. It was designed by Thomas W. Lamb and, as the name of the building implies, operated, like the State Theatre, by the Loewâ€™s circuit. The Ohio Theatre, unlike its larger sister, the State Theatre, was originally designed as a legitimate house, though by the Depression, was used more and more infrequently. In 1935, the Ohio Theatre was converted into the Mayfair Casino, which featured a nightclub with jazz acts onstage. However, the Mayfair Casino didnâ€™t catch on, and closed within a year. Afterwards, the Ohio Theatre was reopened as a movie house, which it remained until February 9, 1969 when it closed with Julie Andrews in â€œStarâ€. Both it and the State Theatre were closed on the same day due to declining attendance. Not long after closing in 1969, vandals set off the sprinklers inside the Ohio Theatre, ruining most of the ornate plasterwork dÃ©cor throughout the theatreâ€™s interior. In the early-1970â€™s, in both the Ohio Theatre and the State Theatre, the auditorium seats were removed and auctioned off, and the ceilings of both theatres were eventually opened in many places to the elements, allowing rain and snow inside. In its later years, the Ohio Theatre had more than its share of challenges. An extensive fire largely gutted the long, ornate inner lobby (which was rebuilt in a drab modern style), and the entire auditorium was painted fire engine red. It was in a sorry state by the time the Playhouse Square Association (formed in 1970) began its ambitious plan to restore all four movie palaces in the Playhouse Square area (the State Theatre, Allen Theatre, Palace Theatre and Hanna Theatre) and slowly funds were raised for the restoration of the Ohio Theatre. In 1977, Cuyahoga County purchased the Loewâ€™s Building, and both of its theatres were added to the National Register of Historic Places the following year. The Ohio Theatre was the first to be restored, reopening in 1982. The auditorium was beautifully restored although with a different (cream and olive green) color scheme, and the modern lobby was freshened up, while the outer lobby was converted into a restaurant. Guests now entered the inner foyer from the State Theatreâ€™s grand lobby. In 1990, the rear part of the Ohio Theatre grand lobby was remodeled into a beautiful semi-Atmospheric style courtesy of a generous donation from the Reinberger Foundation. This was followed by a repainting of the auditorium in 1992 in its original colors and finally in 2016, the grand lobby was restored to its original appearance. Today, restored to its former elegance, the renamed Mimi Ohio Theatre is used for smaller stage performances, concerts and live theatre."

        "Description": "The Hippodrome Building, including the huge Hippodrome Theatre opened on December 30, 1907. The building itself was a unique structure with an eleven-story section facing Euclid Avenue and a seven-story section facing Prospect Avenue. The Hippodrome Theatre stretched between the two avenues. The opening production in the Hippodrome Theatre was the musical â€œCoaching Daysâ€, and the feature of the evening was the exciting spectacle of horses diving into a large water tank built into the front of the stage. Presentations at the Hippodrome Theatre included grand opera, popular musical shows, vaudeville and movies. John Phillip Sousa and Marie Dressler are two of the many name performers who played at the Hippodrome Theatre. [above text from the book â€œPlayhouse Square Cleveland Ohioâ€ written by Kathleen Kennedy, Playhouse Square Association] From 1912 to 1922 it was operated by the B.F. Keith chain and presented movies & vaudeville. This place was HUGE. The main entrance on Euclid Avenue had a marquee and box office and came into a lobby that went through the block to another entrance on Prospect Avenue where there was another marquee and box office. The auditorium was off the lobby to the left, perpendicular to the lobby. It was remodeled by architect Thomas Lamb in 1930 and was taken over by RKO. On November 19, 1933 it was taken over by Warner Bros, reopening with the World premiere of â€œThe World Changesâ€ starring Paul Muni. The times I was there was as a kid in the late-1960â€™s it was a grind house, film running continuously. I never saw the interior with the lights on, so I canâ€™t really say what the architectural style was. It was high and dark. I could barely make out that there were three balconies above the orchestra, but they were always closed in those last years. The Hippodrome Theatre was closed on May 1, 1980 with Ivan Rassimov in â€œSacrificeâ€ & Warren Oates in â€œDrumâ€. It was demolished to make way for, what else, a parking garage."

        "Description": "Even though it was located almost exactly at E. 9th Street and Euclid Avenue, very near the the Hippodrome Theater and Embassy Theater, and also just a few blocks from the grand theaters at Playhouse Square, and operating during the golden days of all those theaters, the Carter Theater is almost forgotten. According to the online Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, \"It opened on October 26, 1913 as the Miles Theater under the direction of president and general manager Chas. H. Miles. The 2,000-seat theater cost nearly $500,000. Billed as \"Americaâ€™s most beautiful vaudeville palace,\" it was decorated in the Louis XIV style in a color scheme of old rose, ivory, cream, and gold, with DuBarry damask on the walls and mahogany seats upholstered in rich green velour, which matched the carpeting. The stuccoed walls contained two French murals on the spaces over the proscenium boxes. The auditorium contained twelve proscenium boxes, twenty-six mezzanine boxes, and two aero boxes. The backs of the seats were equipped with slot machines that would dispense candy for $.05. In 1920, the Miles Theater became a burlesque house and changed its name to the Columbia Theater. Movies were introduced in 1931, when it became the Great Lakes Theater. Between 1935-37 the theater suffered an identity crisis. For a while in 1935 it was called the Miles Theater again and featured vaudeville and first-run movies, then it was a movie theater called the Carter Theater. In 1936, it became the Federal Theaterâ€“part of the Federal Theater Project of the WPA. Operating as the Miles Theater again, it was called a \"flophouse with a soundtrack\" according to a 1937 article in the Plain Dealer. Sometime in 1937 it became the Carter Theater again, owned by the Community Theater Circuit. In 1954, the plaster ceiling fell, injuring 10 patrons. The theater was torn down in 1959."

In the late-1950s, the Circle Theatre received some notoriety for being the first Cleveland venue to host a live stage show featuring Elvis Presley. In its final years, the theatre ran mostly movies, but also staged a live country/western show on Saturday nights."

Guest organist Edward Benedict opened the Kimball organ. Seating was provided for 1,550 in the orchestra level and 350 in the balcony. There were 3 dressing rooms. In 1929 it was taken over by Warner Bros. Circuit Management Corp. and they operated it until 1954 when it was taken over by an independent operator. The huge vertical name sign on the faÃ§ade was damaged by a tornado in 1953 and had to be removed. The theatre had shown sub-run films during the 1970â€™s, and brought in cult midnight movies in the early-1980â€™s. At the same time it became a rock music venue. The theatre was also used as a â€œhaunted theatreâ€ for a couple of years in the 1980â€™s, in which there was a haunted tour of the theatre, while horror films were playing on the screen. Lack of off-street parking and the high cost of utilities and other expenses for a single screen theatre forced the Variety Theatre to close in 1986. Later on, a private school in the Cleveland area, Freedom Academy, used the theatre as a performing arts school. A boxing academy last occupied the Variety Theatre until 1990. Since 2006, the Variety Theatre has been in the process of restoration and renovation by new owners, the Friends of the Historic Variety Theatre, which hopes to reopen the theatre as a venue for both on-screen and live performances. In September 2016 a replica of the original vertical name sign was installed and re-lit. The building was â€˜For Saleâ€™ in summer of 2021. Restoration began in September 2022. The Variety Theatre is a Designated Cleveland Landmark."

In 1923 Bessie Smith appeared on stage, and returned again in 1929 in the show â€œSteamboat Daysâ€. In the 1930â€™s the Ahmediyyih Muslim Community rented space above the lobby to be used as the Cleveland mosque. The Globe Theater was listed in the Film Daily Yearbook 1955 edition as a Negro theatre. It closed in the 1950â€™s, and its auditorium was never used again. The lobby was remodelled and became the Ebony Boy Barbecue take-out eatery. The Globe Theater and surrounding building were later demolished. The site is an empty plot of land in 2014."

Clevelandâ€™s Hough neighborhood was named for settlers Oliver and Eliza Hough who moved there in 1799. M.B. Horowitz opened the Hough-79th Theatre as part of the Washington Circuit. Historic population shifts moved the neighborhood from upper middle class and upper class mainly Caucasian to immigrants to 90% African American Seat. Seat count varied between 750 and 917 but likely ended at the 750 count when CinemaScope screen technology was added in 1955. The theatre also hosted a weekly jamboree, grand ole spry-styled show simulcast on radio hosted by air personalties Tex and Glen Clark The theatre likely closed as a sub-run double-feature discount house for African American audiences in 1964. The former theatre was next to the epicenter of the famous Hough race riots in 1966 that saw a neighboring business, Seventy Niners' CafÃ©, spark a race riot that led to arson, injuries and death. Following the 1966 riots, the Negro Business and Industrial Association took on the Hough-79th Theatre venue planning to transform it into a roller skating rink and community center. The theatre appears to have been demolished in 1984 and the Lexington Village residential units have since been built where the business district once stood."

        "Description": "Opened by 1911, the Ezella Theatre was owned by Modern Theatres, Inc., Owners: The Essex Brothers â€“ Jack & Ray â€“ and a rotund little man named Howard Reif. It was remodeled in 1941-1942 to the plans of architectural firm Matzinger & Grosel. The theatre was almost an exact duplicate of the Vine Theatre in Willoughby, Ohio. My memory is fading, but as best I can recall, it had 1,400 seats on one level. Last time I worked there as a stagehand was in 1958. The place was in good shape â€“ surprisingly so, since it was located in what was even then considered to be a â€œseedyâ€ part of town. There was nothing very unusual about the Ezella. It had a large projection booth, with two Super-Simplex projectors fitted with Peerless MagnaArc lamp-houses; an RCA sound system, and â€œEl Cheapoâ€ anamorphic Cinemascope lenses that were vastly inferior to the Bosch & Lomb lenses that were in wide use at the better theatres around town. One interesting sidelight: Directly across an alley at the rear of the theatre, was a fairly large, two-story wooden storage building that looked like it had survived from the last century. I was told that an undertaker used it to store coffins. About three or-so years after I last worked at the Ezella, I learned that the old building had caught fire, and posed a real danger to the theatre building. Newspaper reports credited a young assistant theatre manager with doing a great job of making an announcement from the stage to the people in the audience, instructing them on the proper manner for safely exiting the theatre. I understand that damage to the Ezella building was minimal. USELESS TRIVIA: The phone number of the Ezella Theatre, back in 1957 was HE-1-2071. (The â€˜HEâ€™ stood for HENDERSON). The building is today home to a church."

        "Description": "The Garden Theatre opened by the Ohio Amusement Co. on August 30, 1924 with Jack Holt in â€œWanderer of the Wastelandâ€. My mother remembered attending in her girlhood, seeing Bela Lugosi in â€œDraculaâ€ during one of its many reissues. Never a first run theatre, it generally opened only on weekends, playing second or third run films on double features. During the 1960â€™s, it was my favorite theatre, simply because it was the one most conveniently located, right down the street from me on W. 25th Street, a few steps down from Clark Avenue. Like most second run neighborhood theatres, they had childrenâ€™s matinees on Saturday and Sunday, often showing something other than the evening attractions, or perhaps adding a third feature to the program. Elvis Presley double features (â€œLove Me Tenderâ€ and â€œJailhouse Rockâ€, with the addition of â€œKid Galahadâ€ for the Saturday-Sunday matinee) were pretty popular, as were horror shows from Hammer and American International (â€œDracula, Prince of Darknessâ€, â€œThe Pit and the Pendulumâ€, etc). I also saw quite a few sword and sandal epics there with Steve Reeves (â€œThe Slave-The Son of Spartacusâ€, â€œHerculesâ€, â€œDuel of the Titansâ€). But the major films played there as well, everything from â€œWest Side Storyâ€ and â€œLawrence of Arabiaâ€ to the James Bond series) once they completed their runs at the downtown theatres and the suburban second run movie houses. The Garden Theatre holds a special place in my memories because it was the theatre in which I was introduced to movies. So besotted was I by the movie posters outside the theatre and in the lobby, I always insisted my mother take me by the theatre when we were in the area, even when it was closed so I could look at the posters and peer in the doorway at the ones for the coming attractions. Otherwise, it was a fairly seedy place for much of its last years. For a long time, there was a hole in the screen that no one bothered to repair. In 1969, the theatre closed with the marquee announcing it would soon reopen as the Pussycat Theatre, which would have given competition to the Paris adult theatre across the street (formerly the Southern Theatre). That never happened, and the Garden Theatre was demolished soon thereafter."

In the 1960â€™s/1970â€™s the Westwood Theatre had shown XXX-rated adult films. The theatre opened as the Hilliard Square Theatre on April 14, 1927 and was built for vaudeville and motion pictures by the Universal Pictures chain. The seating capacity is given as 1,500 in editions of Film Daily Yearbook through the 1940â€™s and 1950â€™s, although in reality it could be 1,200 (800 in the orchestra, 400 in the balcony). It changed its name to the Westwood Theatre in around 1962. By the 1980â€™s, the theatre started showing sub-run Hollywood fare, toward the end charging only 50 cents admission! The theatre closed in 1988, and has been vacant since. Lack of off-street parking, as well as the high cost of operating a single screen theatre, killed the Westwood Theatre. The building stood standing, and nothing was done to the theatre since it closed. It was demolished in February 2017."

The organ was removed in 1934 and transfered to the De Luxe Theatre, Gloucester, England, UK. It was destroyed in 1939 when the De Luxe Theatre lost to a fire. My family attended this theater in the early-1950â€™s and it was still open in 1957. Not to be confused with a smaller theater named Union Theatre at E. 105th Street and Union Avenue."
